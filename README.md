# Projects in Statistical Methods & Text Analysis
### *1. Categorizing news articles*
  ### Your task
  * Given a bunch of Reuters news service articles, develop a set of labels for categorizing them
  * Labels should be a single word or short phrase. Some articles might fit more than one label, and some might not fit any.
  * Aim for about 10–15 labels, give or take
  * Use methods from labs so far (keyword analysis, terminology extraction, topic models)
  * No specific ‘correct’ answer; the process you use to develop the list is more important than the solution.

### Deliverables
* List of labels
* For each label, the number of articles from the dataset that fit that label
* The number of articles that don't fit any of the labels (ideally this won't be a big number)
* Annotated notebook showing your process

<!--
1. upload projects (only include labs you like)
2. consider separating projects into individual repositories (if large files)

### *2. Classifying Mislabeled Wine*
  ### Your task
  * Presented with mislabeled wine bottles, construct a classifier to determine which wine is which
  * Find words that the model is using to predict labels (model coefficients, interpretation through LIME)
  * Find the amount of test examples excluded for F1>.81
  * Improve accuracy by using label changes. Use confusion matrix for a new labeling scheme.

### *3. Topic Models for Amazon video game reviews*
  * multiword expressions, candidate terms, c-values, tokenization, hyperparameter tuning, wordclouds
